## üì∏ Scenario
You are a Software Engineering student preparing your thesis. With many accumulated PDF articles, it becomes difficult to locate and correlate important information.

<br>

## ‚ú® Features

- Upload PDF files for analysis
- Index the content using vector embeddings
- Integration with AI for generating contextual answers
- Functional and user-friendly chatbot interface
- Code modularization for reusability
- Potential for scaling with multiple documents and sessions

  <br>

## üíæ Dataset Example

The content used for this project comes from a PDF document titled "Plant Care Guide", which contains valuable information about how to take care of plants.

1. **Light Requirements**  
   Different plants require different amounts of sunlight to thrive. Some need direct sunlight, while others do well in indirect light.

2. **Watering Requirements**  
   Proper watering is crucial for plant health. Over-watering or under-watering can harm the plant.

3. **Soil Types**  
   Different plants thrive in different soil types. Some need well-drained soil, while others prefer richer, more moist conditions.

4. **Pest and Fungi Management**  
   Common pests and fungal infections that can affect plants, and how to manage them.

5. **Plant Symptoms**  
   Signs of under-watering, over-watering, or improper lighting.

6. **Recommended Plants**  
   Suggestions for plants that are easy to grow or suitable for indoor environments.


  <br>


  ## ‚ùì Sample Questions
  
- "How much sunlight does a cactus need?"
- "What type of soil is best for a fern?"
- "How often should I water my succulents?"
- "What are the symptoms of over-watering a plant?"
- "How can I deal with pests on my plants?"

<br>

## üéØ Goal
Create an **intelligent chatbot** that reads PDFs, indexes their contents, and answers questions based on the provided material, using **generative AI**.

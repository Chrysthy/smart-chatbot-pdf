## 💾 Dataset Example

The content used for this project comes from a PDF document titled "Plant Care Guide", which contains valuable information about how to take care of plants.

| **Topic**                   | **Description**                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Light Requirements**     | Different plants require different amounts of sunlight to thrive. Some need direct sunlight, while others do well in indirect light. |
| **Watering Requirements**  | Proper watering is crucial for plant health. Over-watering or under-watering can harm the plant.  |
| **Soil Types**             | Different plants thrive in different soil types. Some need well-drained soil, while others prefer richer, more moist conditions. |
| **Pest and Fungi Management** | Common pests and fungal infections that can affect plants, and how to manage them.                  |
| **Plant Symptoms**         | Signs of under-watering, over-watering, or improper lighting.                                     |
| **Recommended Plants**     | Suggestions for plants that are easy to grow or suitable for indoor environments.                 |


  <br>


  ## ❓ Sample Questions
  
| Questions |
|-----------|
| How often should I water an indoor plant? |
| What is photosynthesis? |
| Why are my plant’s leaves turning yellow? |
| Which plants need more sunlight? |
| How can I prevent root rot? |
| What should I do if my plant has fungus? |

<br>

## 🎯 Goal
Create an **intelligent chatbot** that reads PDFs, indexes their contents, and answers questions based on the provided material, using **generative AI**.

## ⚠️ Important Notice
Due to limitations with my account, I wasn't able to access some essential resources that require a paid plan. 
However, I understand the project’s logic and plan to revisit and implement it once I have full access to the required tools.
